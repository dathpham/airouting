# Routing In Transportation
This repo includes some widely-used shortest path algorithms ( Dijkstra and A*) and also introduces a reinforcement learning routing primarily used in computer networks into transporation, which is Q-routing
This repo also compares the performance of these algorithms in terms of optimality
